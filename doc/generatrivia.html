	<P
>Generatrivia: define, publish and play your board games in the web.</P
>
	
	<P
>Generatrivia is a html and javascript based application to define and generate boards games like chess, trivia, ludo, and games like that. 
	It supports tools that game definitions can use, like dices, question and answers, pieces definition and initial positioning, etc.
	The users who uses generatrivia for defining a game, must define the game in a text file (javascript - json format), indicating the game board image, 
	defining pieces (image, shape, size, color, name). If the game requires dices, the "dices tool" should be enabled. 
	If the game require questions and answers like in a trivia, questions answers, categories should have to be defined in that file as well. </P
>
	
	<P
>Once this game definition file is ready, the generatrivia javascript framework can be used for executing the game in a web page easily. </P
>
	
	<P
>In generatrivia generated games, the computer do not control any game logic. The players are responsible moving their pieces and in some 
	games perhaps creating the pieces too. Also players are responsible	of controlling that others do not cheat while moving them!! 
	This design has two main advantages:</P
>
	
	<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>the games are defined by board image and rules outside computing. This gives a lot of flexibility for game definition.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>the computer ony replaces paper and dices, so the game experience is almost like the same as a paper made board.</P
></LI
></UL
>
	
	<P
>Also, the framework contain a lot of known board game definitions, 
	like trivias, different kind of chess, checkers, ludo, etc. </P
>
	
	<P
>About the history of the project. The initial idea was to provide teachers with an easy mean of defining trivia games of school subject 
	so students can play agains each other in a single computer in the classroom. I realice that no game logic programming is required for this, since
	students are able of counting points and moving their game pieces by theirself. Then I realice that several board games (the ones that do not require cards), 
	can be sistematically defined for human players only.</P

  The user should know show to work with files, directories and editing text files. </P

></H3
>
  	
  	<P
>in this section we will define our first game, the ludo game. Rules of the game can be fount at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_(board_game). 
  	The ludo game consist on the following elements: </P
>
  	
  	 <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>A board</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>4 colored circular pieces of colors red, blue, yellow and green</P

	<P

><P
><B
>Prepare files. </B
>
	First of all you have to download and decompress generatrivia somewhere. 
	Your game will be use some of these files.
	
	Second, we will prepare your game's directory and files. For this, simply copy generatrivia's src 
	directory to somewhere. Rename with your game's name, in this case "ludo".  This directory
	will be where your trivia game will be stored. All following steps will be working in this dir.
	</P
></DIV
></LI

><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>The board image. </B
>
	Create or copy your game board's 'image from internet. Put in on your game's directory and call it ludoboard1.png. 
	
	For our ludo we will use the following image:

	    <DIV

><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>Define the game in a text file. </B
>
	The last and more important step is 
	to define all of our game's elements in a the game definition text file. For this, first create a file called data.js and open 
	it with your favourite plain text editor	
	<A
NAME="AEN92"
HREF="#FTN.AEN92"

	pieces: [
         {name: "red piece", code: "circle(10, 10, 10, 10)", 
        	 size: "20,20", color: "#ff0000"},
        	 
         {name: "blue piece", code: "circle(10, 10, 10, 10)",

    ]
}
	</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>  
	The file contents must be a valid javascript - json object string. 
	
	Let's introduce the data.js file and explain what 's inside briefly.
	
	First of all the game definition file is defined using the programming language json. 
	It is recommended but not mandatory that the user is familiarized with it: http://json.org/
	
	As you can see, there are some properties defined as gameName, boardImage, 
	boardSize and pieces. boardGame indicates what this game is called ("ludo"), and boardImage indicated the image file that will be used
	as game's board ("ludoboard1.png"). 
	
	The more complex one is pieces. Remember we said the game ludo
	 consist in 4 pieces of color red, green, blue and yellow. So the "pieces" property is telling just that. The following 
	 code defines a single game piece (circular piece of size 20 x 20 pixel and color red-#ff0000):

>Now let's play. </B

	In our ludo game, before playing the players must create the necesary pieces. Asuming 
	will be 4 players, we create 4 pieces of each colors red, blue, green and yellow and move them in the board
	to their initial positions. For moving the pieces, just add them and then drag them with the mouse to desired board position. 
	We perform this using the "Add Piece" tool at the left top corner:

  <P
>Trivia game can be used by (high)school teachers for knowledge review, 
  for example the class before an exam. For example, a philosofy teacher, can perform a trivia with questions of different studied topics like epistemology, logic, ethics. Optionally the teacher want's 
its trivia to contain a nice famous painting as board background. Generatrivia 
is an excelent tool for this because the teacher only has to focus on its 
questions and answers and generatrivia will do the game work. It is up to the teacher
to spend time decorating the board with its own image. Also the rules of the game are defined in the classroom.
