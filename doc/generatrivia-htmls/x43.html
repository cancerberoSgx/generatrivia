	<P
>Generatrivia: define, publish and play your board games in the web.</P
>
	
	<P
>Generatrivia is a html and javascript based application to define and generate boards games like chess, trivia, ludo, and games like that. 
	It supports tools that game definitions can use, like dices, question and answers, pieces definition and initial positioning, etc.
	The users who uses generatrivia for defining a game, must define the game in a text file (javascript - json format), indicating the game board image, 
	defining pieces (image, shape, size, color, name). If the game requires dices, the "dices tool" should be enabled. 
	If the game require questions and answers like in a trivia, questions answers, categories should have to be defined in that file as well. </P
>
	
	<P
>Once this game definition file is ready, the generatrivia javascript framework can be used for executing the game in a web page easily. </P
>
	
	<P
>In generatrivia generated games, the computer do not control any game logic. The players are responsible moving their pieces and in some 
	games perhaps creating the pieces too. Also players are responsible	of controlling that others do not cheat while moving them!! 
	This design has two main advantages:</P

><P
>the games are defined by board image and rules outside computing. This gives a lot of flexibility for game definition.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>the computer ony replaces paper and dices, so the game experience is almost like the same as a paper made board.</P
></LI
></UL
>
	
	<P
>Also, the framework contain a lot of known board game definitions, 
	like trivias, different kind of chess, checkers, ludo, etc. </P
>
	
	<P
>About the history of the project. The initial idea was to provide teachers with an easy mean of defining trivia games of school subject 
	so students can play agains each other in a single computer in the classroom. I realice that no game logic programming is required for this, since
	students are able of counting points and moving their game pieces by theirself. Then I realice that several board games (the ones that do not require cards), 
	can be sistematically defined for human players only.</P
